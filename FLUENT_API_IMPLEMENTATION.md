# Fluent API Implementation - Involuntary Offboarding Application

## Overview

This document describes the ServiceNow SDK Fluent API implementation for the involuntary offboarding application. All table definitions, business rules, and data migration scripts are now implemented using the modern Fluent API approach.

## Project Structure

```
src/fluent/
├── index.now.ts              # Main entry point - imports all Fluent APIs
├── tables.now.ts             # Table definitions and field configurations
├── business_rules.now.ts     # Business rules and automation logic
├── data_migration.now.ts     # Data migration scripts from SharePoint
├── sample_data.now.ts        # Sample data creation scripts
└── example.now.ts            # Original example (can be removed)
```

## Fluent API Files

### 1. `tables.now.ts` - Table Definitions

This file contains all table and field definitions using the Fluent API:

#### Tables Created:
- **`x_snc_offboard_employee`** - Employee master data (extends sys_user)
- **`x_snc_offboard_case`** - Offboarding cases (extends task)
- **`x_snc_offboard_transition_language`** - Transition language templates
- **`x_snc_offboard_case_timeline`** - Timeline tracking for cases
- **`x_snc_offboard_document`** - Document generation and tracking
- **`x_snc_offboard_template`** - Document templates

#### Key Features:
- **Choice Fields**: Properly defined with all options from SharePoint data
- **Reference Fields**: Links between tables for data integrity
- **Auto-numbering**: Case numbers with format `OFFBOARD-{YYYYMMDD}-{0001}`
- **Default Values**: Appropriate defaults for boolean and choice fields
- **Field Validation**: Required fields and length constraints

### 2. `business_rules.now.ts` - Business Logic

Contains all business rules and automation logic:

#### Business Rules:
1. **Employee Age Calculation** - Calculates age and sets over_40 flag
2. **Case Auto-Assignment** - Assigns cases based on employee region
3. **State Change Notifications** - Sends notifications on case state changes
4. **Timeline Generation** - Creates timeline items when case is created
5. **Document Generation** - Generates documents when case reaches appropriate state

#### Key Features:
- **Compliance Logic**: OWBPA requirements, age-based rules
- **Regional Assignment**: Automatic assignment based on employee country
- **Timeline Automation**: Creates 11 timeline items per case
- **Document Automation**: Generates documents based on case requirements

### 3. `data_migration.now.ts` - Data Migration

Handles migration of SharePoint data to ServiceNow:

#### Migration Functions:
- **`migrateEmployees()`** - Migrates all 8 employees from SharePoint
- **`migrateCases()`** - Migrates all 6 cases with proper relationships
- **`migrateTransitionLanguage()`** - Imports all 14 transition language templates

#### Key Features:
- **Data Validation**: Checks for existing records before inserting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and counting
- **Relationship Mapping**: Properly links cases to employees
- **Status Mapping**: Maps SharePoint statuses to ServiceNow states

### 4. `sample_data.now.ts` - Sample Data Creation

Creates sample data for testing and demonstration:

#### Sample Data:
- **Document Templates**: 5 different document templates
- **Sample Documents**: Creates documents for existing cases
- **Data Validation**: Validation script to verify migration

## Building and Deployment

### Prerequisites
- ServiceNow SDK 4.0.0 or higher
- Node.js and npm installed
- ServiceNow development instance

### Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to ServiceNow
npm run deploy

# Generate TypeScript types
npm run types
```

### Deployment Process

1. **Build**: The SDK compiles all Fluent API definitions
2. **Transform**: Converts Fluent APIs to ServiceNow metadata
3. **Deploy**: Installs the application in ServiceNow
4. **Activate**: Tables and business rules become active

## Data Migration Process

### Step 1: Deploy the Application
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 2: Run Data Migration
After deployment, run the data migration script:

1. Go to **System Definition > Scripts - Background**
2. Create a new script with the content from `data_migration.now.ts`
3. Execute the script to migrate SharePoint data

### Step 3: Create Sample Data
Run the sample data creation script:

1. Go to **System Definition > Scripts - Background**
2. Create a new script with the content from `sample_data.now.ts`
3. Execute the script to create sample data

### Step 4: Validate Data
Run the validation script to verify the migration:

```javascript
// Validation script from sample_data.now.ts
validateMigratedData();
```

## Expected Results

After successful deployment and migration:

### Tables Created:
- 6 custom tables with proper relationships
- 50+ fields with appropriate data types and constraints
- Choice lists with all SharePoint options

### Data Migrated:
- **8 Employee records** from SharePoint
- **6 Case records** with proper employee relationships
- **66 Timeline items** (11 per case)
- **18+ Document records** (3+ per case)
- **5 Document templates**
- **14 Transition language templates**

### Business Rules Active:
- Age calculation and compliance flag setting
- Automatic case assignment by region
- Timeline generation for new cases
- Document generation based on case requirements
- State change notifications

## Advantages of Fluent API Approach

### 1. **Version Control**
- All definitions in code
- Git-friendly format
- Easy to track changes

### 2. **Repeatable Deployment**
- Consistent deployments across environments
- No manual configuration required
- Automated build process

### 3. **Type Safety**
- TypeScript support
- Compile-time error checking
- Better IDE support

### 4. **Modern Development**
- Follows current ServiceNow best practices
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better team collaboration

### 5. **CI/CD Ready**
- Can be integrated with build pipelines
- Automated testing capabilities
- Environment promotion workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Errors**
   - Check TypeScript syntax
   - Verify all imports are correct
   - Ensure proper field types

2. **Deployment Issues**
   - Check ServiceNow instance connectivity
   - Verify user permissions
   - Review deployment logs

3. **Data Migration Issues**
   - Check for existing data conflicts
   - Verify field mappings
   - Review error logs

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Check build output
npm run build --verbose

# Test deployment
npm run deploy --dry-run

# Generate types for debugging
npm run types
```

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Set up Access Control Lists (ACLs)** for security
2. **Create workflows** based on timeline items
3. **Build user interfaces** using Service Portal
4. **Configure integrations** with Workday and DocuSign
5. **Set up monitoring and reporting**

## Support

For issues with the Fluent API implementation:

1. Check the ServiceNow SDK documentation
2. Review the build and deployment logs
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Test in a development environment first

The Fluent API approach provides a modern, maintainable foundation for your involuntary offboarding application that can easily scale and adapt to changing requirements.
